          <p>
            &emsp;Halfway between the mustard brown station wagon and her
            first-floor apartment, Mia let loose a string of curses. Instead of
            sleeping in her own bed that night, she was to sleep in a stranger’s
            home to keep an ancient, 79lb monster of a German Shepherd company
            while his owner was away. Mia had forgotten about the dog named
            Fritz, and when her expletives ran dry, she sighed the kind of sigh
            that came from deep within – the kind that said
            <em>this well is empty</em>.
          </p>
          <p>
            &emsp;She crunched through the leaves blanketing the path to her
            apartment, working all the while to pin the source of her sullen
            mood that day. It wasn't entirely the dog, or the old woman's
            apartment, with its nauseating stench of potting soil and water
            damage. Mia traipsed over the threshold of her own door, ignoring
            the heap of mail pooling beneath the mail slot or kicked in every
            direction. She was at least two hours late in feeding Fritz and
            letting him out. She shook an envelope from her shoe – a red banner
            proclaimed its FINAL NOTICE in bold type. Mia decided the monstrous
            dog presented a more imminent threat to her well-being and left the
            notice there, stamped with the wet imprint of her heel.
          </p>
          <p>
            &emsp;“He gets rambunctious when he’s been alone…” the old woman,
            Cristina, had chuckled over a gnarled and bony shoulder on the night
            Mia met the owner, the dog, the apartment. Fritz spent the entire
            meeting lunging and baying at Mia, who shrunk into a corner near the
            door while Cristina, unperturbed by Fritz’s behavior, droned on
            about the medications and food portions <em>little Fritzie</em> was
            accustomed to.
          </p>
          <p>
            &emsp;Mia winced at the memory of the dog, all white flashes of
            teeth and distrust. She gathered her toothbrush, make-up bag,
            clothes to sleep in and a fresh uniform for the restaurant the
            following day.
          </p>
          <p>
            &emsp;She didn't mind dog-sitting at first. The extra money was all
            that kept the lights on, and aside from the travel and walks, the
            work was not very time consuming. Mia was mostly paid to sleep - to
            make anxious animals feel less alone in the hollow hours of the
            night, when darkness tugged on all assurances of safety.
          </p>
          <p>
            Mia tossed her belongings into a backpack, fetched her pillow and
            checked the time. She would be two hours and forty-five minutes late
            in caring for Fritz. She darted into the kitchen and grabbed a
            bottle of extra-strength melatonin. Sleep did not come easily in
            strange places. By the time Mia stepped back out into the February
            chill, droplets of freezing rain pattered the grounded leaves. She
            shielded her pillow - her own pillow - from the wet.
          </p>
          <p>
            Ten minutes later, she unlocked the old woman’s door and cracked it
            by half an inch. Alarmed by the unexpected silence, Mia stuck her
            whole head inside and looked about. On his bed near the couch, Fritz
            was motionless. Mia stepped inside and shut the door, frozen in the
            same spot she had cowered into upon meeting Fritz the week before.
            She set down her things, removed her shoes and gingerly walked to
            where the old dog lay.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Fritz,” her voice cracked, weak and child-like in her own ears.
            Fritz lifted his head and sniffed at the air. He gave Mia a sulky
            look and settled his massive jaw back down on his paws. Mia hunched
            over with a glorious exhale. “I thought I killed you...” She
            considered the dog in repose, thinking of the way children often
            turned especially raucous in front of their parents, only to behave
            quite differently with others when their parents were not around.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Show-off,” Mia smiled. She went into the kitchen and prepared his
            dinner with great care, following Cristina’s detailed instructions.
            Fritz remained watchful on his bed, while Mia was sure to keep the
            dog within her sights. It had taken a single meeting with a Labrador
            that very autumn to shake Mia's childhood belief that she shared
            some sacred connection with every creature she met. The Labrador,
            likely catching the scent of some other charge, had snapped at Mia's
            outreached hand and snagged a tooth in the meaty flesh of her palm.
            Two stitches didn't warrant reporting the dog, and though the owner
            was grateful, Mia was deemed as a “poor fit” and lost the client.
            She was no mediator between realms after all.
          </p>
          <p>
            After crushing up the last of his pills and mixing the chalky powder
            into a bowl of boiled chicken and kibble, Mia tried from a distance
            to coax Fritz into eating. When this did not work, she tried willing
            him to go for a walk by shaking his leash near the door as Cristina
            had instructed.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Easy, easy,” Cristina had sung in an accent Mia couldn't quite
            place. Fritz would have none of it now, and Mia resented the old
            woman's mirth from the night they met.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Not so <em>easy, easy,</em>” Mia grumbled. In an act of brave
            abandon, she tried at the very least to pet the dog, but a low growl
            effectively reminded her they were not friends. She curled herself
            onto the couch and glared at Fritz. For three nights, she would have
            to come here after work and do this. Fritz inflated, gave an
            indignant huff and looked away from Mia. She stuck her tongue out at
            the dog and settled deeper into the cushions.
          </p>
          <p>
            The place was freezing, but Mia never dared change anything about
            the homes in her care. She looked about, suddenly wondering if she
            was on camera, and noticed a blue, yellow and red striped flag
            pinned to the wall behind her. She pulled her phone from her back
            pocket and determined the flag was that of Romania. Next to the
            flag, a framed puzzle hung offensively askew – the image of a
            sprawling landscape around a medieval-looking castle. Mia resisted
            the urge to straighten it, turned back to her phone and began her
            nightly ritual. After thumbing through pictures, posts and news
            articles for over an hour, Mia’s heart snagged on a headline:
            “Fourteen-Year-Old Girl Stabbed to Death in McKinley Park.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Instantly, Mia recalled this headline as the source of the weight on
            her soul that day. She had seen it the previous night, when sleep
            eluded her. Somewhere between three and four in the morning, Mia had
            wondered about the sharpness of things - what it felt like, being
            stabbed to death. A ghost in the moonlight, she had walked into her
            own kitchenette, pulled three knives from the wooden block and
            pressed their cold points into the soft flesh of her belly - as far
            as they would go without breaking skin. She thought about her
            cousin, Rosemary, who would turn fourteen the following year. She
            replaced the face of the anonymous girl, the “corpse found near the
            restrooms,” with the lively, freckled face of Rosemary and felt sick
            at the pain, imagining the blades forced in all the way. Mia
            couldn't reconcile herself to the thought that this could
            <em>actually</em> happen to someone, happened all the time, had just
            happened to a <em>child</em> less than a mile from her apartment. It
            was simply too awful of a way to die, yet there it was.
          </p>
          <p>
            Mia couldn’t recall when she started playing this game with herself
            – this stepping into the horrors on her newsfeed and making them
            feel as real as they were. She guessed it was around the same time
            she had to start experimenting with different sleep-aids to get her
            through her nights without wondering about sharp objects. Whether
            bullets burned when they entered your body. What a classroom of dead
            children <em>really</em> looked like.
          </p>
          <p>
            Mia closed out her phone and placed it face-down on the couch. Fritz
            was asleep, wheezing and twitching every so often. Mia got up to
            make her rounds through the tiny apartment, touching objects and
            inspecting books – half a dozen ESL aids sat nestled between titles
            in a language Mia couldn't decipher. She surmised they were Romanian
            and moved on, curious about a display of miniature bridges and water
            towers on top of the bookshelf. An unopened box on the floor
            sporting an intricate, ready-to-assemble miniature cellphone tower
            suggested Cristina had built all the models herself.
          </p>
          <p>
            Mia was surprised at her own amusement, as though she had not
            considered the old woman could have interests of her own. She slid
            into the chair of a desk directly next to the bookshelf. There,
            another puzzle lay partially assembled, partially asunder. Mia took
            in the various patterns and colors, found a piece that seemed part
            of chapel spire nearly fully assembled by Cristina, and locked it
            into place. Pleased with the meager contribution, Mia moved to get
            up when a pile of stretched canvasses, roughly stacked beneath the
            desk caught her eye. She crouched down and looked through seven
            painted landscapes, one unfinished portrait of a young woman, and a
            Rockwellesque scene of a funeral in progress. In the very back was a
            portrait of Fritz. The paintings all bore the same initials – CcT.
            Cristina...cel... cel something. Mia couldn't quite recall the last
            name. Something in the portrait of Fritz touched Mia, as though the
            old woman had taken particular care with every brush stroke to
            capture his likeness. The painted Fritz looked far more forgiving
            than the dog Mia had thus far been acquainted with. She stood and
            looked again at the puzzle, took up the piece of church spire and
            returned it to the place she had found it in.
          </p>
          <p>
            Mia tip-toed into the kitchen, poured herself a glass of water and
            squeezed every fat leaf of a window-sill succulent, until she
            squeezed one too hard and a viscous spray burst across the window
            and part of the wall. She clasped a hand across her mouth to hold
            the laughter, cleaned the mess, rotated the plant and turned her
            attention to an ornate floral calendar stuck to the fridge. Across
            the dates Mia was scheduled to care for Fritz, Cristina had written
            in her own commitment: <em>Chemo, Dr. Leitzman, NYC</em>. The
            specter of laughter fell from Mia's lips. She slipped into the
            living room, where Fritz remained sleeping, and collected her
            things.
          </p>
          <p>
            Mia migrated to the bedroom and sunk her weight into the bed. There,
            on the nightstand, a framed picture of Fritz and Cristina sat beside
            a ragged English dictionary. In the picture, Fritz was lean and
            muscular - a proud animal. Cristina held up a blue rosette, smiling
            as wide as her lips would allow without showing teeth. From the
            dictionary, loose pages peeked out and beckoned. Mia could not
            master her curiosity. She pulled them and placed the open book
            face-down on the mattress, putting a slew of H-words to bed. The
            first loose page held a prognosis, many of its words highlighted or
            underlined. The second held their meanings, hand-written in English,
            each followed by several indecipherable lines. Tiny dots of water
            damage blotted the unfamiliar shapes and swirls. Something shifted
            inside of Mia’s chest - the heaviness giving way. She toppled
            forward, dropped her face into her hands. Somewhere in her mind,
            water towers and bridges were blown to smithereens.
          </p>
          <p>
            Mia heaved in short, convulsive breaths. She closed her eyes, trying
            to dam the unforgiving flow of midnight thoughts, where bullets and
            blades entered flesh, again and again, and none of it mattered.
            <em>Good people. So many good–</em> Mia cried with abandon, until
            the muscles in her stomach contracted and spasmed. Something warm
            touched the side of her elbow, and Mia opened her eyes.
          </p>
          <p>
            Fritz stood before her, swaying and shivering with his deep brown
            eyes full of concern. He smacked his lips and gave a cry. Mia tried
            to pronounce his name, but she couldn’t relax the muscles in her
            throat enough to form speech. The old dog stepped forward, nestled
            his large head into her lap and sighed, as if to say:
            <em>I know. I know all about it.</em>
